# Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs
### This analysis utilizes a GeoJSON dataset to visualize the magnitude of earthquakes around the world

## Overview
As a data visualization specialist for a hypothetical non-profit company specializing in data-driven story-telling on disasters around the world, my task is to build an insightful, interactive visualization on worldwide earthquakes. The company hopes that these intuitive earthquake maps will heighten public awareness of the non-profit. Using the most recent GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website and leveraging the D3 and Leaflet libraries in JavaScript, the latest earthquakes and their magnitudes are plotted on a mapbox map that was accessed through an API request.
